# Black Friday Landing Page
Landing Page developed as a challenge for the Hiring Coders Bootcamp.

The idea was to implement a Landing Page regarding a Black Friday sale with the following requirements:

* Develop the website template  
* Text Field and Submit Button for e-mail data; 
* Save Data at browser's LocalStorage

It was an application developed using only HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript, and some custom styles from the internet.
